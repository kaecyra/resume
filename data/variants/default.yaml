summary: |
    Seasoned technology leader and systems-thinking CTO with a deep background in
    software architecture and operations. I've led engineering organizations of
    approximately 300 people, delivered multi-team eight-figure engagements, and
    scaled a SaaS business from $0 to $10M ARR that culminated in acquisition.

    I combine strategic vision with hands-on technical ownership and a product-led
    mindset--driving automation, observability, multi-cloud resilience, customer
    obsession and people-first cultures that increase delivery velocity while
    reducing operational cost and human toil.

    I am a force of nature when surrounded by other leaders with a shared vision
    and focused on a goal I believe in.
