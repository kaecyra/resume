summary: |
    Technology leader and systems-thinking CTO with a deep background in
    software architecture and operations. I've led engineering organizations of
    approximately 300 people, delivered multi-team eight-figure engagements, and
    scaled a SaaS business from $0 to $10M ARR that culminated in acquisition.

    I stay hands-on technically while leading at scale--building automation,
    observability, and resilient multi-cloud infrastructure that cuts operational
    cost and human toil without sacrificing delivery speed.

    I am a force of nature when surrounded by other leaders with a shared vision
    and focused on a goal I believe in.
