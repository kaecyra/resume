    summary: |
      Assumed global leadership of a 310-person engineering org during extreme organizational
      volatility. Stabilized retention of critical senior talent, stood up an AI-native product
      capability (LiveVision) with commercial validation at CES and NVIDIA GTC, and engineered
      operational frameworks that aligned staffing, margin, and delivery into a single system of record.

          higher total utilization and lower overhead than industry standard public cloud
          alternatives, demonstrating durable and extensible infrastructure design.
