title: "Chief Technology & AI Officer"

summary: |
  Technical executive who builds the systems — technical and organizational — that make AI-native
  operations inevitable. Architected and delivered a real-time AI video processing platform from
  concept through commercial validation (CES 2026, NVIDIA GTC 2026), while leading a 310-person
  globally distributed engineering org through extreme volatility. Deep expertise in data governance,
  security compliance (SOC2 from scratch), and infrastructure sovereignty — translating technical
  vision into measurable business impact across multiple business units and acquisitions.

  greeting: "Dear Hiring Team,"
  body: |
    I'm writing regarding the Chief Technology & AI Officer role. You're looking for someone who can own company-wide technology and AI strategy, design agentic operating models, establish data governance, and lead the cross-departmental workflow transformation that turns AI from a buzzword into an operational advantage. That's the work I've been doing — and I'd like to tell you why.

    At .Monks, I lead a 310-person engineering org distributed across three continents. When I stepped in, the org was in turmoil following my predecessor's exit, with 30+ concurrent projects at risk. I stabilized the team through radical transparency and data-driven resource management, maintaining 90%+ retention of critical talent. Then I went on offense: I architected LiveVision, an AI-powered real-time video processing platform, by putting underutilized engineering resources to work and securing non-traditional Capex funding for DGX Spark infrastructure. I proved viability through a live demo at CES 2026 and earned an invited presentation at NVIDIA GTC 2026. That's what it looks like when a technology leader doesn't just talk about AI strategy — they build it, validate it, and present it to the world.

    The role calls for someone who can determine which decisions should be automated versus human-directed, and who can architect AI agents across departments. I've been making exactly those calls — designing the operating models that decide where AI adds leverage and where it doesn't. My staffing automation work replaced ad-hoc spreadsheets with a data-driven system that generates finance-ready reporting automatically, a practical example of identifying workflow bottlenecks and deploying intelligent automation where it actually matters.

    On data governance and compliance: I built an Infosec organization from scratch at Vanilla Forums, achieving SOC2 compliance and transforming security from a cost center into a sales lever that unlocked the Fortune 500 market. I've scaled infrastructure across four data centers with a private-cloud-first strategy that maintained fiscal sovereignty. Post-acquisition at Higher Logic, I led the modernization of five global platforms, standardizing engineering practices and de-risking single-point-of-failure architectures. I understand the compliance, security, and governance frameworks that underpin responsible AI deployment.

    I've spent my career at the intersection of technology strategy and organizational scaling — from a first-employee SaaS startup through profitable acquisition, to stabilizing a 300+ person global engineering org. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how that experience maps to what you need in a CTAO.
  closing: "Best regards,"
