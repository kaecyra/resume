title: "Director of Engineering"

summary: |
  Technical engineering leader who builds distributed platforms from scratch and scales
  them through multiple infrastructure generations. Designed and operated a multi-tenant
  SaaS runtime with custom scheduling, resource isolation, and fault-tolerant deployments
  across heterogeneous infrastructure. Built the control plane, observability, and
  provisioning systems that powered thousands of concurrent workloads — then scaled the
  engineering organization around it. Player-coach who stays close to systems architecture
  while leading through managers across globally distributed teams.

  greeting: "Dear Anyscale Hiring Team,"
  body: |
    I'm writing regarding the Head of Ray Core / Director of Engineering role. You're looking for a technical leader who can own the vision and execution for a foundational distributed runtime — someone who combines deep systems architecture instincts with the organizational leadership to grow a senior team and drive quality through RFCs, design reviews, and long-term API strategy. That intersection of building distributed infrastructure and scaling the team around it is where I've spent the formative years of my career.

    At Vanilla Forums, I designed and built the multi-tenant SaaS hosting platform from the ground up. This wasn't a wrapper around managed services — it was a custom distributed runtime with its own scheduling, resource isolation, provisioning, and fault tolerance. I built a proprietary agent-based control plane that handled provisioning and monitoring across multi-provider, multi-region deployments, establishing a "single pane of glass" observability system that gave us real-time visibility into thousands of concurrent tenant workloads. When the public cloud couldn't deliver the performance margins and reliability we needed, I executed a full cloud repatriation — migrating to private infrastructure and scaling from one to four data centers, including EU expansion for data sovereignty. That platform was the technical foundation that carried Vanilla from $0 to $10M ARR and through a profitable acquisition.

    The systems problems I solved at Vanilla map directly to Ray Core's problem space: cluster scheduling and resource management across heterogeneous infrastructure, fault tolerance and recovery for long-running distributed workloads, performance optimization at the infrastructure layer, and building abstractions that let application developers focus on their work instead of the platform underneath. The difference is scale and ecosystem — and that's exactly the kind of challenge I want to take on.

    I'm also a long-time open-source contributor. I served as a core contributor to the Vanilla Forums open-source ecosystem, working on the security, extensibility, and performance of a platform powering thousands of global communities. I understand the dynamics of maintaining widely-used APIs, balancing contributor community needs with product direction, and establishing design and quality standards that hold up as the contributor base grows.

    At .Monks, I lead a 310-person engineering org across NA, LATAM, and EMEA — managing through directors and senior managers. I've built the organizational systems for operating at that scale: staffing frameworks, margin models, talent databases, pre-sales technical authority programs. But I remain a player-coach at heart. I architected LiveVision, an AI-powered real-time video processing platform, hands-on — designing the edge-broadcast pipeline and model inference orchestration — and then presented the architecture at NVIDIA GTC 2026. I stay close to the technical work because that's where sound decision-making originates.

    I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how this experience maps to what Anyscale needs for Ray Core's next chapter.
  closing: "Best regards,"
