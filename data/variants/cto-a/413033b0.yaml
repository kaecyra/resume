summary: |
  Engineering executive who builds and scales product engineering organizations across
  geographies — from first hire through 300+ engineers. Led a $0 to $10M ARR SaaS platform
  through profitable acquisition, then stabilized a globally distributed org spanning three
  continents during extreme volatility. Hands-on technical leader who stays close to
  architecture and code while owning P&L, budgets, and organizational design. Builds the
  operational frameworks that turn engineering investment into predictable, measurable output.

  greeting: "Dear PAR Technology Hiring Team,"
  body: |
    I'm writing regarding the VP, Software Engineering role leading the Punchh engineering organization. You're looking for a leader who can drive engineering strategy across a 120+ person multi-geography team, own the P&L, enforce technical standards, and build the hiring and organizational systems to sustain a $100M ARR product through its next growth phase. That description — scaling a SaaS product engineering org across geographies while maintaining technical depth and operational discipline — is the arc of my career.

    At Vanilla Forums, I built the SaaS product engineering organization from the ground up. I designed the multi-tenant hosting architecture, built the provisioning and monitoring systems, and hired and developed the engineering team that operated them — from the first engineer through a profitable acquisition by Higher Logic. That journey took us from $0 to $10M ARR and required building everything: the platform, the teams, the leadership layers, the compliance programs (SOC2 from scratch), and the cross-functional operational infrastructure that made sustained growth possible. Post-acquisition, I led the modernization of legacy infrastructure across five global platforms, transitioning manual deployments to automated blue/green pipelines and de-risking single-point-of-failure architectures.

    At .Monks, I lead a 310-person engineering org distributed across North America, Latin America, and EMEA — managing through directors and senior managers across 30+ concurrent engagements. I own the operational frameworks: I built a data-driven staffing and margin system that replaced spreadsheets with automated, finance-ready reporting, deployed a searchable talent database for resource allocation, and stood up a pre-sales SME program that gave senior engineers direct influence on deal flow. I understand what it means to own an engineering P&L and make the numbers work across geographies.

    On the technical side, I remain hands-on. I architected LiveVision, an AI-powered real-time video processing platform, and presented the architecture at NVIDIA GTC 2026. I engage in architectural reviews, drive technical standards, and maintain the credibility with senior engineers that comes from having built real systems at scale. The player-coach model isn't aspirational for me — it's how I've operated for over a decade.

    I'm particularly drawn to the Punchh platform's scale — $100M ARR handling $25B in annual sales — and the multi-geography engineering challenge across Toronto, Austin, and Jaipur. I've built and led exactly this kind of organization and I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how that experience translates to what PAR Technology needs.
  closing: "Best regards,"
