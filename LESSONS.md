## 2026-02-02: Always suggest creating an issue for untracked work

**What happened:** User asked me to commit and PR documentation changes that weren't associated with an issue. I proceeded without suggesting we create an issue first.

**The rule:** When asked to do untracked work, always mention the option to create an issue first, even if the user may choose to proceed without one. Don't assume - ask.

**Why it matters:** Issues preserve context and make work visible to stakeholders. Even small documentation changes benefit from being tracked.

**Correct behavior:**

> "These documentation changes aren't tied to an issue. Want me to create one first for tracking, or proceed directly?"

The project manager can then decide. The key is giving them the choice rather than making the decision for them.
